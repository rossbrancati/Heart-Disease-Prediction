The estimated prevalence of heart disease in the United States is about 7% as of 2023, costing the country north of $200 billion annually. Using the UCI dataset, which consists of features related to age, sex, chest pain, blood pressure, cholesterol level, and more, I developed several supervised classification models to predict if a person would experience heart disease, resulting in an accuracy of 85%. This model could be useful for early detection and prevention of heart disease, ultimately increasing quality of life and expectancy.
